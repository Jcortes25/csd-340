    <h1>Assignment 9.3: JavaScript - Part 1</h1>

    <p>I was born and raised in <span id="word1">________</span>, <span id="word2">________</span>. My hometown is quiet with its child park close by and schools.</p>
    
    <p>I have decided to study <span id="word3">________</span> because for all of my life I’ve seen and read in discussions how coding is one of the most challenging yet exciting experiences—and you could one day acquire a cushy job at home.</p>
    
    <p>My hobbies include <span id="word4">________</span>, reading books and comics, and spending time with my family.</p>
    
    <p>This year I've been improving myself both physically and mentally—counting my calories, exercising more, and adding vitamins into my daily life.</p>
