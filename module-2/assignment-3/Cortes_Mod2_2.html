        <p class="intro">I was born and raised in Maryland,Hyattsville. My hometown is quiet with its child park close by and schools.</p>
        
        <p>I have decided to study coding because for all of my life I seeing and reading on discussions how coding is one of the most challenging yet exciting experience and you could one day acquire a cushy job at home.</p>
        
        <p>My hobbies include playing video games, reading books and comics and spending time with my family.</p>
        
        <p>This year I've have been improving myself both physically and mentally. Counting my calories, excercising more and adding vitamins into my daily life.</p>
